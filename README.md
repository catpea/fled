### Architecture

### This Is An Operating System; But Do Not Worry About Relying On CORS

Use proxies like https://allorigins.win/ (host them yourself) to fetch data from all around the internet.
You will never be cut-off this way.

### Communication Stack; Or, Use The Bus Luke

- Bus
- Database

The Bus is high speed, when you change something in one place. You can communicate that throughout all UI components.

Database sits lower than the bus, because it is slow, at least in theory.

## Do Not Ask About The Parent; Keep The Database Simple By Grounding Everything Down

Do not ask who is my parent. Spell it the frick out. If you do need a structure. Say that file location equals /a/b/c/d/e/f.
But never say that b's parent is a, or that a has children of b. There is no time for lockups like this.

Keep the database flat, no trees, keep it simple, relating records together is about storing references to record id/s that need to be related.

### shadow dom

Note that WebComponents (ie CustomElements with shadowDOM) need CustomEvents with the composed:true property if you want them to bubble up past its shadowDOM boundary

### Snippets


app.context.db = db();

app.use(async ctx => {
  console.log(ctx.db);
});


app.on('error', (err, ctx) => {
  log.error('server error', err, ctx)
});


app.use(async ctx => {
  ctx; // is the Context
  ctx.request; // is a Koa Request
  ctx.response; // is a Koa Response
});


ctx.state
The recommended namespace for passing information through middleware and to your frontend views.
ctx.state.user = await User.find(id);

### document server

To load a new CouchDB document simply say: ```document.id = some_id```,
the ```document``` mentioned above is a svelte store like object.

.id is a setter that will trigger fetching the CouchDB doc,
and eventually whoever is lightening to document via $document auto-binding,
will get the doc with the requested id.

think of the document as a server that serves CouchDB docs,
by assigning a new id, it will provide you with the matching doc.

perhaps a better way would be load(new_id) document.id = some_id is prettier.

You do not need to provide an ID, the document/Document tolerates not having an id,
this way, the "server" can be setup before it is put into play.

The mini-apps withing use ```import { db, document } from './my-mini-app/store.js';``` approach,
for inter mini-app communication, so this is possible now:

```html
{#each some_list as {id, label}}
  <button class="btn btn-link" on:click={()=> document.id = id } >{label}</button>
{/each}
```

## Development Notes
use EventEmitter
use #if it helps to deal with chicken and egg problems.
remember that left hand must be clear for the compiler to see it.

## Editor spacevim
SPC f v d

[[layers]]
  name = "lang#html"
  emmet_leader_key = "<C-e>"
  emmet_filetyps = ['html']


:set filetype=html
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.svelte set filetype=html
